# DL_Assignment_1

### General info
* It aims at implementing Feedforward neural network from scratch.
* Implementation is done using classes.

#### forward_propagation:
* It takes images from the fashion-mnist data as input and outputs a probability distribution over the 10 classes.
#### back_propagation:
It performs backpropagation and supports following optimisation functions:
* sdg
* momentum
* nesterov
* rmsprop
* adam
#### predict:
* It enables us to predict the labels of the data values on the basis of the trained model. 
#### others functions
* Consists of gradients of activation functions and evaluation metrics
